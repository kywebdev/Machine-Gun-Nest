											<p>If you are transferring in more than one firearm on the same 4473/77R transaction, you will be charged full price for the first firearm on the application and $10 for each additional firearm. This applies to SAME transactions only.</p>
											<p>If you don't see that specific firearm you've had your eye on available in our in-store inventory, don't worry. Talk to a TMGN Crew Member and we will look into ordering it for you. Please note, per our store policy, a 50% Non-Refundable Deposit is required when you place the order. If you purchased a firearm elsewhere (offline or out of state) and need it transferred in to MD, we've got you covered! Forward your order details to: <a href="mailto:nicole@themachinegunnest.com">NICOLE@THEMACHINEGUNNEST.COM</a></p>

											<p>* In addition to your transfer fee, you can also expect a $10 MD State Application Fee, if submitting a MDSP 77R, as well as a $30 MD Barrel Lock that we require customers to have when they pick up their firearm after the 7-day wait. This is a caliber specific lock; required with all handgun purchases. If you do not have one already, we sell them in-store for $30 per lock, per caliber.</p>

											<p>**Effective November 2017: If you have a firearm transferred in and it sits here for longer than 1 month after we receive it there will be a $25 storage fee, per month, that it resides in our safe. If you purchase the Class III item from us, the storage fee does NOT apply to the Class III transfer. HOWEVER, if you fail to come in to complete and submit the ATF paperwork within 2 months of TMGN receiving the Class III item from our distributor, you will THEN be charged a $25.00 storage fee. This will occur every month thereafter until you DO come in and submit paperwork with us. If you are transferring a Class III item in to us, TMGN has the right to charge storage fees. Feel free to message us directly for a price quote, to avoid these added fees!</p>
